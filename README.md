# Zen

It is what it is. What else do you need?

## Preparation

### MacOS

- Install dependencies:
```
$ brew install direnv cmake ninja doxygen
```
- [Hook `direnv` into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)
- `direnv allow` from the root of the repository

### Linux

You're on your own ;)

### Windows

Maybe one day.

## Build & run

`b` to build, `c` to clean, `r` to run, `br` to build and run.
